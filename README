Overview
========

This is the SCST development repository. It contains not a single
project SCST as one can think, but a number of them, which are divided
as the following:

1. SCST core in scst/ subdirectory

2. Administration utility for SCST core scstadmin in scstadmin/

3. Target drivers in own subdirectories qla2x00t/, iscsi-scst/, etc.

4. User space programs in usr/ subdirectory, like fileio_tgt.

5. Some various docs in doc/ subdirectory.

Those subprojects are in most cases independent from each other,
although some of them depend from the SCST core. They put in the single
repository only to simplify their development, they are released
independently.

Thus, use "make all" only if you really need to build everything.
Otherwise build only what you need, like for iSCSI-SCST:

make scst scst_install iscsi iscsi_install

For more information about each subproject see their README files.


QLogic target driver
====================

The QLogic target driver qla2x00t is the old driver, forked from qla2xxx
several years ago. It is very stable, well tested and actively used in
many production setups.

There is also a new driver that supports 32 Gb/s FC in the qla2x00t-32gbit
directory. That driver has not yet reached the same maturity level as the
old qla2x00t driver.
