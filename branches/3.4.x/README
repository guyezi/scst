Overview
========

This is the SCST development repository. It contains not a single
project SCST as one can think, but a number of them, which are divided
as the following:

1. SCST core in scst/ subdirectory

2. Administration utility for SCST core scstadmin in scstadmin/

3. Target drivers in own subdirectories qla2x00t/, iscsi-scst/, etc.

4. User space programs in usr/ subdirectory, like fileio_tgt.

5. Some various docs in doc/ subdirectory.

Those subprojects are in most cases independent from each other,
although some of them depend from the SCST core. They put in the single
repository only to simplify their development, they are released
independently.

Thus, use "make all" only if you really need to build everything.
Otherwise build only what you need, like for iSCSI-SCST:

make scst scst_install iscsi iscsi_install

For more information about each subproject see their README files.


QLogic target driver
====================

QLogic target driver qla2x00t is the old driver, forked from qla2xxx
several years ago. It is very stable, well tested and actively used in
many production setups.

There is also new driver, maintained by QLogic, which, among other,
supports 32G FC, see http://scst.sourceforge.net/target_qla2x00t.html.
You can find the latest version of it in git://git.qlogic.com/scst-qla2xxx.git.

To integrate it into the SCST build tree you need to clone the QLogic
git tree in a subdirectory of this directory (SCST root tree) with name
qla2x00t_git (or create a symlink with this name pointing to any other
location in your system).

Now common and QLA specific root Makefile targets "magically" start
working with the new driver. Then follow instructions in the git's
README.

In presence of qla2x00t_git subdirectory you can still build the
qla2x00t using qla_old* root Makefile targets.
